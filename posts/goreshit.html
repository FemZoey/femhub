        A review of their music and why do I like their songs.
        <br>
        Goreshit is a british breakcore artist, who has made albums like:
        <br><br>
        	-Overspecialized<br>
            -Rituals<br>
            -Semantics: The Benzo Chronicles<br>
        <br>
        Among these "Semantics: The Benzo Chronicles" being my favourite,<br>
        as it's the album which hosts "Burn this moment into the retina of my eye".<br>
        I first found Goreshit thru the rythm game osu which hosts some of his songs<br>
        as beatmaps (users can download these and play them), but then I started listening<br>
        to his music without it being on osu, and my this artist has some of the best songs I've ever heard,<br>
        for the breakcore genre that is.<br>
        Their songs make me have a feeling of uneasyness but comfort at the same time, I feel wrapped by the ever so<br>
        more violent drum kicks and snares, it feels like all of my worries and issues are leaving my body and I'm becoming one<br>
        with the song and it's rythm. This is what makes me like Goreshit, their music is just.. something out of this world, something<br>
        scary yet comforting.<br>
        Of course there are other breakcore artists like "Svwerslvt", who has a lot of good songs, but their songs don't give me the same feeling<br>
        as Goreshit's do.
        <br><br>
        Anyways thanks for listening to my cringey post about an artist I like!<br>
